# UI/UX Engineer Candidate Task
This is a paid task, with up to $800 awarded.

This award will be based on the evaluation criteria. The primary goal is to compensate for the time this task may take. Our aim is to gain a signal for skill and capability; we're not using any submission for the business.

We prefer you keep your submission private and add https://github.com/R-K-H and https://github.com/metaproph3t to the repo when you're ready for review.

## Choose One Of The Following Tasks
Choose one of the following tasks to demonstrate your UI/UX engineering skills. Each task is designed to showcase different aspects of frontend development and user experience design.

**NOTE: All tasks SHOULD include the following**
1. Create a wireframe or rough sketch of the interface layout using any tool you're comfortable with (e.g., Figma, draw.io, or even pen and paper).
2. Use any modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for component development. React is preferred but not mandatory.
3. [Integrate real-time data fetching](#data-sources) from the CoinGecko API (and Solana API if used).
4. All three tasks will require you to create your own dataset for comments.

**Choose ONE of the following tasks to complete:**

- [Charting And Comments](#charting-and-comments)
- [Data Visualization Dashboard](#data-visualization-dashboard)
- [Mobile-First Social Trading App](#mobile-first-social-trading-app)

### Charting And Comments
Design and implement a charting interface with an interactive comments component using the provided dataset.
  - A real-time price chart for Solana (SOL) using data from the CoinGecko API
  - Display key metrics such as 24h trading volume, market cap, and circulating supply
  - A comments component with response functionality, using the generated comment dataset

### Data Visualization Dashboard
Create a multi-view dashboard that transforms complex price and comment data into insightful, interactive visualizations, demonstrating your ability to present information clearly and engagingly.
  - Multiple real-time visualizations of Solana data (e.g., price chart, token distribution, network statistics)
  - An interactive time range selector for historical data
  - A heatmap or calendar view showing trading volume or price changes

### Mobile-First Social Trading App
Design and implement key screens of a responsive, mobile-first social trading app that seamlessly integrates price trends with user comments, focusing on creating an engaging and intuitive user experience for on-the-go traders.
  - A main feed showing live Solana price trends, network stats, and recent comments
  - A portfolio overview section (use mock data for demonstration)
  - A filterable and sortable comment list with real-time updates

## Data Sources
Real-time Data:
  - Use the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time Solana (SOL) price data.
  - API Documentation: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation
  - Endpoint example: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/solana
  - You may also use Solana's own API for additional blockchain data if desired: https://docs.solana.com/developing/clients/jsonrpc-api
  - Implement real-time updates for the price data (e.g., using websockets or polling)

## Deliverables
   - A GitHub repository containing your project
   - Steps to be able to run the project
   - A README.md file with:
     - A brief explanation of your design decisions and any assumptions made
     - Any additional features or improvements you would add given more time

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality and correctness of the implementation
- Code quality, organization, and best practices
- Effective use of the provided dataset
- Component structure and state management
- User experience and interface usability (appropriate to the chosen option)
- Error handling and application reliability
- Understanding and representation of Solana-specific concepts (if applicable)

## Time Allocation
- Basic Interface Sketch/Wireframe: 1-2 hours
- Implementation: 8-10 hours
- Total estimated time: 9-12 hours

Choose the option that best aligns with your skills and interests. Please note that while we provide a time estimate, we understand that actual completion time may vary. Focus on delivering a high-quality solution that showcases your skills in both design and development.
